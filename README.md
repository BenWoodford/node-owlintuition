node-owlintuition
=================

node.js library for the [OWL Intuition range](http://www.theowl.com) of energy monitoring and control systems. It has been tested against v2.0 and v2.1 of the Network OWL firmware.

Install
-------

npm install owlintuition

Usage
-----

Create an instance of the owl class and connect to the multicast broadcast from the Network OWL,

    var OWL = require('owl');
	monitor.connect();

you can subscribe to four different event messages. 

###Electricity

The first message is for electricity updates,
	
	monitor.on('electricity', function( event ) {

	});
	
where you will receive an event object of the form,
	
	{"id":"443719001958",
	 "signal":
	    {"rssi":"-66",
	     "lqi":"127"},
	 "battery":"100%",
	 "channels":
	    {"0":[
	        {"current":"241.00", "units":"w"},
	        {"day":"823.49", "units":"wh"}],
	     "1":[
	        {"current":"0.00", "units":"w"},
	        {"day":"0.00", "units":"wh"}],
	     "2":[
	        {"current":"0.00", "units":"w"},
	        {"day":"0.00", "units":"wh"}]}}		

as an argument to your callback function. The channels contain data for the current reading and the daily total for each of the channels/phases on the electricity transmitter. If the transmitter only has 1 channel, the last 2 channels will always contain 0 values.

###Heating

The second message is for heating updates, and will only occur if a Intuition-c Room Monitor has been installed,	

	monitor.on('heating', function( event ) {
		
	});

where you will receive an event object of the form, 
	
      {"id":443719001958,
       "signal":
          {"rssi":-66,
           "lqi":49},
       "battery":"2970mV",
       "temperature":
          {"until":1373409000,
           "zone":0,
           "current":21.25,
           "required":20}}
	
passed back as an argument to your callback function. The temperature subsection, contains the current room temperature and the required room temperature. Both values are in degrees Celsius.

###Weather

The third and last message type is for periodic local weather updates,

	monitor.on('weather', function( event ) {
		
	});
	
where you will receive an event object of the form,

      {"id":443719001958,
       "code":113,
       "temperature":"26.01",
       "text":"Clear/Sunny"}
	
passed back to your callback function. The temperature is the current outside temperature for the postcode assigned to the Network OWL. The text is a textural description of the weather at that postcode.

###Solar

Finally the fourth message is for solar updates, and will only occur if an Intuition-pv system is installed,

    monitor.on('solar', function(event) {
	
    });

where you will receive an event object of the form

      {"id":"443719001958",
       "current":[
          {"generating":1000,"units":"w"},
          {"exporting":730, "units":"w"}],
       "day":[
          {"generated":23000, "units":"wh"},
          {"exported":17000, "units":"wh"}]}

This contains sections for the current solar readings and the totals for the day. Both sections have generated and exported keys that contain the values for power generated by the PV system and power exported to the electricity grid.

###Unknown

There is also an error message if the module encounters a 'new' unknown message over multicast,

	monitor.on('error', function( error ) {
	
	});	
	
where a Javascript Error object will be returned. The string describing the unknown message will contain both the original multicast XML packet, and the JSON translation of the message.
